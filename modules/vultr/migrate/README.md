# Vultr resource import helper

Run the generator script to build a Pulumi import specification for Vultr
instances and object storage buckets.

```bash
./generate_import_spec.py
```

Review the resulting files, ensure that matching resource definitions exist in
your Pulumi project, and then execute the generated import commands.
